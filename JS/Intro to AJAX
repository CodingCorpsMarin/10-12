AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML
Asynchronous means some code will run while others wonâ€™t
XML stands for eXtenisble Markup Language, it stores and transports data
AJAX allows you to update certain portions of your page dynamically without having to reload the entire page. (jQuery only makes visual changes, AJAX changes will be persistent)

Applications
Use AJAX in conjunction with jQuery to create dynamic web page components
